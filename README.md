# ‚ÄúWhat was the 2,000,000th building added to OSM in Ireland‚Äù

The [OSM community in Ireland](https://www.openstreetmap.ie/) is engaged in another multi-year mapping project, to [map all the buildings in Ireland](https://tasks.openstreetmap.ie/).

## Installation

If you want to calculate this data yourself:

* Download the latest [full OSM history file from Geofabrik for Ireland](https://osm-internal.download.geofabrik.de/europe/ireland-and-northern-ireland.html) ([`ireland-and-northern-ireland-internal.osh.pbf`](https://osm-internal.download.geofabrik.de/europe/ireland-and-northern-ireland-internal.osh.pbf) currently 381 MB).
* Create a local PostgreSQL database.
* Install the latest version of [`osm-tag-csv-history`](https://github.com/amandasaurus/osm-tag-csv-history) (technically ‚â• v0.5).
* Then run `./calculate.sh`. `results.csv` has the output.

## Notes

* ‚ÄúIreland‚Äù here refers to the island of Ireland
* Only `way` & `relations` are analyzed, not `nodes`
* Sometime OSM data is ‚Äúredacted‚Äù, and removed from the history, so it's _techncially_ possible for someone to have added some others. The goal of this is for fun, nothing too serious.
	* In Sept 2012 changed it's licence to the current ODbL. Some people didn't agree to this change (or were uncontactable)
	* Copyright infringing edits are also redacted (because OSM doesn't have permission to distribute that data)
* This code is copyright 2022 ¬©, released under teh Affero GNU GPL v3+.
